I am a PhD student in Animal Science at [Virginia Tech](https://sas.vt.edu/people/graduate-students/schettini-gustavo.html/). My research projects involve integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and reproductive physiology data to gain insights into genetic mechanisms associated with heifer infertility and early embryo development in cattle using bioinformatics.
